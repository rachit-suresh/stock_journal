   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow prompts:**
   - Link to existing project? No
   - Project name: stock-journal
   - Directory: `./`
   - Build settings: Auto-detected

### Update API URL:

After backend is deployed, update frontend to use production backend URL:

**Edit `frontend/src/services/auth.ts`:**
```typescript
private baseUrl = "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/auth";
```

**Edit `frontend/src/api/client.ts`:**
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = "https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1";
```

### Redeploy frontend:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## üé® Alternative: Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

### Deploy to Netlify:

1. **Install Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g netlify-cli

## üîß MongoDB Setup

If you don't have MongoDB yet:

1. **MongoDB Atlas (Free):**
   - Go to [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
   - Create free cluster
   - Get connection string
   - Add to Railway environment variables

---

## üìù Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Backend deployed and running on Railway
- [ ] MongoDB connection working
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Frontend deployed to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Frontend API URLs updated to production backend
- [ ] Test user registration at `/register`
- [ ] Test user login at `/login`
- [ ] Test creating trades
- [ ] Test price fetching with real Finnhub API

---

## üéØ Quick Test

After deployment:

1. Visit your frontend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
2. Click "Sign up" 
3. Create a new account (e.g., username: `test`, password: `test123`)
4. Should auto-login and redirect to dashboard
5. Click "New Trade" and test with ticker `AAPL` or `INFY`
6. Verify price fetch works with Finnhub

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend issues:
- Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check MongoDB connection string format

### Frontend issues:
- Verify API URLs point to correct backend
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS is enabled in backend (already done in `app/main.py`)

### API Issues:
- Verify Finnhub API key is valid (test at finnhub.io/dashboard)
- Check rate limits (60 calls/min for free tier)
- Verify Exchange Rate API key is valid

## üîê Security Notes

**Before going live:**
1. Change `SECRET_KEY` in `app/core/auth.py` to a secure random string
2. Add it to Railway environment variables
3. Use proper MongoDB user with limited permissions
4. Enable HTTPS (Railway and Vercel do this automatically)
